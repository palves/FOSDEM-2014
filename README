* Abstract

In this talk, I will present an overview of the current state of
several GDB projects of interest to Valgrind developers looking at
GDB/Valgrind integration, including the current state of GDBserver in
GDB, where we are on local vs remote feature parity, all-stop vs
non-stop modes, multi-process and multi-target projects, reverse
debugging, and possibly others.
